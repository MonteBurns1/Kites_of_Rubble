Kites of Rubble is a graphic design graduation project highlighting the resilience and lost innocence of children in Gaza. The project uses visual storytelling—combining powerful imagery of rubble with the hopeful symbolism of kites—to raise awareness of the humanitarian crisis and the impact of war on childhood.

It explores the intersection of art, activism, and empathy, offering posters, digital assets, and design concepts that can be used for exhibitions, campaigns, and educational purposes.
